# ArtHive

ArtHive is an open-source Content Management System (CMS) designed specifically for artists, with a focus on creating a living archive of all the ephemera around their shows. It enables artists to upload and tag photos, texts, and videos, and use those tags to populate and organize content for easy exploration.

## Project Goals
ArtHive is built with the intention of providing artists with an intuitive, flexible platform to document and showcase the full breadth of their work and creative processes. The CMS emphasizes the importance of tags, allowing artists and audiences to "rabbit hole" through related pieces and collections seamlessly.

## Key Features
- **Media Upload and Tagging**: Artists can upload photos, videos, and text entries, applying tags to each item to facilitate organization and browsing.
- **Tag-Based Navigation**: ArtHiveâ€™s design allows for easy exploration based on tags, enabling a dynamic, interconnected archive.
- **Collaborative Access**: Artists can add collaborators or guest users, making it a flexible tool for project teams.
- **Responsive, Artist-Friendly UI**: Using Vue.js and Vuetify, ArtHive offers a polished, accessible interface that is mobile-first in design.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask with Firebase for data storage and authentication
- **Frontend**: Vue.js and Vuetify for the UI, enabling a consistent and responsive user experience
- **Deployment**: Considered platforms include Netlify or Render for efficient and scalable hosting
